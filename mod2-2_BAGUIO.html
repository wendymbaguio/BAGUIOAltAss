				Iwakura Mitsumi, a diligent and ambitious student, has always held tight to her dreams of escaping her quaint hometown, securing a spot at a prestigious university, and ultimately, changing the world. With her eyes firmly set on the future, she embarks on a journey that takes her from the tranquility of her small town to the bustling chaos of Tokyo, where dreams and reality collide.

The transition proves to be more daunting than Mitsumi could have ever imagined. Tokyo's high school life is a whirlwind of fast-paced academics and bewildering city dynamics, a stark contrast to the quiet life she once knew. As the city's frenetic energy threatens to engulf her, she finds an unexpected lifeline in the form of Shima Sousuke, a charming and laid-back classmate with a smile that can chase away the darkest of clouds.

Mitsumi and Sousuke's paths intertwine, their friendship blossoming amidst the neon lights and crowded streets of Tokyo. Together, they navigate the challenges of city life, forge unbreakable bonds, and confront the pressures of academia. As Mitsumi's once-unwavering determination wavers, Sousuke's unwavering support becomes her anchor in this unfamiliar world.

Nominated for the 2020 Manga Taisho Award, this enchanting story will skip its way into your heart, leaving you with a smile and a renewed belief in the power of friendship and the pursuit of one's dreams.
